# 🚀 Mourabaha Portfolio Optimization

### A Strategic Data-Driven Approach
This repository hosts the implementation of the research article: "Managing Mourabaha Financing Risk via Quadratic Programming: A Strategic Asset Allocation Approach."

🎯 Project Overview
In the context of participatory finance, managing a Murabaha portfolio requires a delicate balance between maximizing returns and adhering to strict Sharia-compliant investment constraints. This project leverages Quadratic Programming (QP) to provide a robust, data-driven framework for optimal asset allocation.

🛠 Key Features
Mathematical Optimization: Implements the SLSQP algorithm to maximize the Sharpe Ratio under complex linear constraints.

Sharia-Compliant Strategy: Enforces "Long-Only" constraints and specific sectoral bounds to align with institutional mandates.

Financial Robustness: Includes Winsorization to neutralize the impact of market outliers and ensure stable portfolio performance.

Decision Support: Provides a comprehensive analytical suite, including Rolling Volatility analysis and Risk-Return profiling.
